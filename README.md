# This map is for Lethal Company V45

# LCRed-More-Moon
Add more moons to Lethal Company. You can choose what you want to add!

# This mod requires
1. [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/)
2. [LethalExpansion](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/HolographicWings/LethalExpansion/)

# Moons List
+ Venity
+ DPR

# Known Issue
- Monsters and other entities are only able to fall down and cannot jump or climb (this may be an advantage to you)

# Instalation
Place the .lem file inside ```BepInEx/plugins/Modules/```.
Don't forget to add LethalExpansion.lem alongside other dll files (by default, it's already inside the [LethalExpansion](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/HolographicWings/LethalExpansion/) mod)
